        Book Donation System is works towards making education available to all, across the geographical and social 
        boundaries. Book Donation System will make this possible by providing free books to those who have the desire 
        to read but lack of resources to buy. The main objective of developing this Book Donation System is to make the 
        donation system for the NGOâ€™s, Donor and Needy People easy, feasible and dynamic. This project is an effort to 
        find out a way to find a suitable place i.e. an online platform where people who want to donate books can find 
        places to donate and persons or libraries or any other institutions concerned who want to receive the donated 
        books will be able to receive them.
